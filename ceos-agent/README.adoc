# CEOS Agent

This is a simple test to integrate with _Crossbreed Energy OS_ to onboard a new _HVAC_ equipment that will use a district heating optimizer service (Crossbreed Smarter Heating).

## Installation

First make sure to setup a virtual environment with the required dependencies (see below).

.Install Dependencies
[source,bash]
----
conda create --name chainlit python=3.11
conda activate chainlit
pip install -r requirements.txt
----

Then, you can run the agent with the following command:

.Run Agent
[source,bash]
----
chainlit run app.py -w
----

Where the _w_ flag is to run the agent in _watch_ mode, which means that the agent will restart automatically when the code changes.

## Uninstall

If you need to completely remove virtual environment, you can run the following commands.

.Remove Virtual Environment
[source,bash]
----
conda deactivate
conda env remove --name chainlit
----

This will completely remove everything from your local system.
