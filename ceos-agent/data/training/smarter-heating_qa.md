You need to provide with the following information:

* What type of controlling equipment do you have? Siemens, Schneider, etc.
* What type of indoor climate sensors do you have? Wideco, Telia, Sensitive etc.
* How to access your equipment.

* The type of system and the identifiers for _CEOS_ to determine how to access it. Depending on the vendor it may be different.

## I have a siemens system, what do I need to provide?
You need to provide with the following information:

## How do I install the indoor climate sensors?
It is important that you install the indoor sensors in the right place. The sensors should be placed in the middle of the room, at a height of 1.5 meters. The sensors should not be placed in direct sunlight or near heat sources such as radiators or lamps. Do not place any sensors near windows or doors.

Place one sensor at the north wall and one at the south wall to be able to measure the temperature difference between the two sensors.
